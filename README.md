# Test Drive a Simple Banking App

Based on the following user stories, I will create simple banking app using test driving development processes.

## User Stories
```

```
```
* As a customer,
* So that I can spend my money,
* I would like to withdraw money from my account

```
* As a customer,
* So that I can budget,
* I would like to view my balance
```

My process will be to adopt a rigorous TDD process using Red, Green and Refactor.

To setup the bank_account app folder with rspec:

```
* mkdir bankaccount
* cd bankaccount
* rspec --init
```
